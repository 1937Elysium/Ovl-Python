## 2021.1.0 Changelog
### Changes from last patch: 

### Additions:
 - New Threshold object BinaryThreshold, can preform binary threshold on an image, supports Otsu binarization.
 - New Detector Class, responsible for detecting objects in an image,
   this responsibility has been extracted from `Vision`
 - New Detector, ThresholdDetector uses a Threshold object to detect contours in an image
 - New Detector, HaarCascadeDetector, supports haar-cascade descriptor loading for detection of targets
 - `Camera` now has `Camera.get_image()` for a more convenient way of getting the image. 
 - new contour_filter, `size_ratio_filter` which filters contours based on the ratio between 
   the width and height of the straight bounding rectangle 
 - Added 2 new code examples
 - crop_contour_region, a function that crops our the region of a contour in an image.
 
### Changes:
 - morphological functions have been removed from `Vision` and moved to ThresholdDetector
 - threshold removed from `Vision`, now passed to ThresholdDetector - all related functions moved also to ThresholdDetector
 - `Vision` now uses detector as the object responsible for target detection.
 - `display_contours` and `display_image` now use a boolean instead of int for delay; minor performance increase
 - Rewritten `image_center_filter`, now had min and max ratio distance parameters, also cleaned up function
 - Cleaned up some sorter functions, should have small performance improvements
 - Cleaned up many contour filters
 - contour_filters in `Vision` and vision like are now called target_filters, to be more generic
 - `Connection.__exit__` now automatically calls `Connection.close`, changed implementations no match it.
 
### Renames:
 - `Camera.isOpened` -> `Camera.is_opened` 
 - `Camera.getBackedName` -> `Camera.get_backend_name`
 - `xy_center_direction` -> `xy_normalized_directions`
 
### Removals:
 - Drawing has been removed
 - HsvCalibration has been removed, will be re-added in a later iteration
 
### Documentation:
 - We now officially have a documentation available at: 
 - added docs folder containing rst documentation and static docs
 - Fixed formatting for multiple functions and classes
 - Added doc-strings for many functions and classes
