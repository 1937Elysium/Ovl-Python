## 2020.1.8 Changelog
### Changes from last patch: 

### Additions:
 - `Camera` now has `Camera.get_image()` for a more convenient way of getting the image.

   the width and height of the straight bounding rectangle 
 - Added 2 new code examples
 
### Changes:
 - `display_contours` and `display_image` now use a boolean instead of int for delay, minor performance increase

 - Cleaned up many contour filters
 - contour_filters in `Vision` and vision like are now called target_filters, to be more generic
